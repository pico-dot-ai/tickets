# TICKETS.md - AI-Native In-Repo Ticketing

This repository uses a repo-native ticketing system designed for **parallel, long-running agentic work** and normal human collaboration, without relying on external services or internet access.

**TICKETS.md ** explains the workflow, file formats, and required tool usage for both humans and agents. If there is ever a conflict between this file and other docs, follow this file.

## What this system is
- A lightweight, Markdown-first ticket format stored under `/.tickets/`.
- A merge-friendly history model: **append-only JSONL run logs**, one file per run, per ticket.
- A repo-local CLI (`./scripts/tickets`) that is the **single integration surface** for humans, agents, and IDE/agentic tooling.

## What this is trying to do
Parallel, long-running agentic work fails in predictable ways:
- Agents lose context across runs/sandboxes.
- Ticket “state” can drift across branches before merge (eventual consistency).
- Shared mutable log files are merge-conflict hotspots.
- Agents can loop without clear “done” criteria or verification steps.

This system addresses those problems with stable `ticket.md` files, merge-friendly per-run logs, and explicit acceptance + verification + bounded iteration guidance.

## Non-negotiables (for merge safety and auditability)
- **Keep `ticket.md` stable and human-readable.** Put history in run logs.
- **Append-only logs.** Never rewrite or delete log lines.
- **Use the repo-local CLI for automation.** Don’t invent parallel formats.

## Quickstart (humans and agents)

### Initialize
Create the repo structure and templates (idempotent):
- `./scripts/tickets init`

This creates (if missing): `/.tickets/`, `TICKETS.md`, and `AGENTS_EXAMPLE.md`.

### Create a ticket
- `./scripts/tickets new --title "Short title"`

This prints the new ticket ID (a lowercase UUIDv7) and creates:
- `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/ticket.md`
- `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/logs/`

### Validate, then work
- `./scripts/tickets validate`

If validation fails and you want a complete report + repair plan:
- `./scripts/tickets validate --issues > issues.yaml`
- `./scripts/tickets repair --issues-file issues.yaml --non-interactive`

### Log your work (human or agent)
Use the CLI to write logs whenever possible (merge-friendly, structured, and tooling-validated).

Agentic tools (including human-invoked tools like Cursor/Windsurf/Codex CLI/Claude Code) SHOULD log with `--machine`:
- `./scripts/tickets log --ticket <id> --actor-type agent --actor-id "cursor (human:@alice)" --summary "Implemented validator." --machine`

Humans can log without machine marker:
- `./scripts/tickets log --ticket <id> --actor-type human --actor-id "@alice" --summary "Investigated failing test; will retry tomorrow."`

---

## Repository layout
- Canonical workflow guide: `TICKETS.md`
- Ticket storage root: `/.tickets/`
- One ticket per directory: `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/`
  - Ticket definition: `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/ticket.md`
  - Run logs: `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/logs/<run_started>-<run_id>.jsonl`

Notes:
- `<ticket-id>` is a **lowercase UUIDv7** string.
- Tooling MUST NOT require the directory name to match the `id` in front matter (convention only).

---

## Ticket definition (`ticket.md`)
Ticket files are Markdown documents with YAML front matter and a Markdown body.

### YAML front matter
Front matter MUST start at the first line and be enclosed by `---`.

#### Required fields
- `id`: lowercase UUIDv7 string
- `title`: string
- `status`: `todo|doing|blocked|done|canceled`
- `created_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC (use `Z`)

Example:

```md
---
id: 0191c2d3-4e5f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d
title: "Add tickets validate --issues"
status: todo
created_at: 2026-01-29T18:42:10Z
---
# Ticket
...
```

#### Optional fields
**Assignment and mode**
```yaml
assignment:
  mode: mixed   # human_only | agent_only | mixed
  owner: null   # "@alice", "team:core", "agent:codex"
```

**Priority and labels**
```yaml
priority: medium      # low | medium | high | critical
labels: ["bug", "docs"]
```

**Relationships (the only ones written in v1)**
```yaml
dependencies: []   # ticket IDs this ticket depends on
blocks: []         # ticket IDs this ticket blocks
related: []        # ticket IDs related to this ticket
```

**Agent limits (hard limits for agents)**
```yaml
agent_limits:
  iteration_timebox_minutes: 20
  max_iterations: 6
  max_tool_calls: 80
  checkpoint_every_minutes: 5
```

**Verification commands**
```yaml
verification:
  commands:
    - "python -m pytest"
    - "./scripts/tickets validate"
```

Important:
- Other relationship views (parent/child rollups, duplicates, supersedes, reverse edges, etc.) are computed by tooling and MUST NOT be persisted in `ticket.md`.
- There is no `updated_at`. “Last updated” is derived from log timestamps (`ts`).

### Ticket body sections (required)
The ticket body MUST include these sections (at least the headings):
- `# Ticket`
- `## Description`
- `## Acceptance Criteria` (checkable list)
- `## Verification` (commands or steps)

---

## Status model
Status values: `todo`, `doing`, `blocked`, `done`, `canceled`.

Recommended transitions:
- `todo` -> `doing` | `canceled`
- `doing` -> `blocked` | `done` | `canceled`
- `blocked` -> `doing` | `canceled`
- `done` and `canceled` are immutable unless explicitly reopened by a human (set to `doing` and log why).

Status updates:
- `./scripts/tickets status --ticket <id> --status doing --log`

---

## Run logs (append-only JSONL)
Every ticket directory has `logs/`. Logs are where history lives; they are designed to be merge-friendly under parallel work.

### File naming: `<run_started>-<run_id>.jsonl`
- `run_started` is the run start time (UTC). It is a *hint* for processing order (tools may process newer runs first by sorting filenames).
- Tools SHOULD emit `run_started` in ISO 8601 **basic** form for filenames, e.g. `20260129T184210.123Z`.
- `run_id` is an identifier for the run (tool-generated unless provided).

Example filename:
- `/.tickets/<id>/logs/20260129T184210.123Z-0191c2d3-....jsonl`

### `ts` vs `run_started`
- `run_started` is constant for a given run file (and appears on every line so each JSON object is self-contained).
- `ts` is per entry (the moment that particular log entry was written).
- “Last updated” is derived from the newest `ts` across all logs, not from filenames.

### Log entry schema (one JSON object per line)
Required fields:
- `ts`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for the entry
- `run_started`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (same for all entries in the file)
- `actor_type`: `human|agent`
- `actor_id`: string identifier (freeform)
- `summary`: short summary string

Optional structured fields (recommended):
- `changes`: `{files: [...], commits: [...], prs: [...]}`
- `verification`: `{commands: [...], results: "pass|fail|explain why not run"}`
- `tickets_created`: `[...]` (ticket IDs created during this run)
- `created_from`: string (parent ticket ID when created by splitting)
- `context_carried_over`: `[...]` (bullets describing copied/adapted context)
- `decisions`, `next_steps`, `blockers`: lists of strings

Machine marker:
- If a log entry is written by the `tickets` CLI with `--machine`, it MUST include a machine marker:
  - `written_by: "tickets"` or `machine: true`

Validation strictness:
- Machine-marked entries are validated strictly.
- Non-machine entries are validated best-effort (warnings by default), so humans can jot notes without breaking the system.

Example machine-written entry:
```json
{"ts":"2026-01-29T18:50:00Z","run_started":"20260129T184210.123Z","actor_type":"agent","actor_id":"codex-cli (human:@alice)","summary":"Implemented tickets validate --issues.","verification":{"commands":["./scripts/tickets validate"],"results":"pass"},"written_by":"tickets"}
```

Merge conflict rule (rare):
- If a `.jsonl` file conflicts, keep all lines from both sides; do not “clean up” history.

---

## Required tool usage (agents and automation)
To keep state consistent and merge-friendly, agents and agentic tools SHOULD use the CLI for ticket operations:
- Create tickets: `./scripts/tickets new`
- Validate: `./scripts/tickets validate` (or `--issues` for a full report)
- Repair: `./scripts/tickets repair --issues-file ...`
- Status changes: `./scripts/tickets status --log`
- Work logs: `./scripts/tickets log` (use `--machine` when the entry is tooling-written)
- Listing/triage: `./scripts/tickets list` (use `--json` for automation)

Humans may edit `ticket.md` directly (it is designed for that), but logs should be appended via the CLI whenever feasible.

---

## Agent task assignment at launch time

### Principle
Agents SHOULD NOT choose tickets autonomously by default. In this system, a human or orchestrator assigns a specific ticket (or a small set of tickets) to each agent run. This avoids duplicate work when multiple agents operate from the same repo snapshot and cannot coordinate live.

### Required inputs for any agent run
Every agent run MUST be given, in its initial instructions (prompt, task description, CLI args, PR comment, IDE task, etc.):

1. Ticket locator
   - A ticket ID, which maps to the ticket definition at:
     - `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/ticket.md`

2. Task scope
   - A short statement of what the agent is expected to do on that ticket (for example: "implement acceptance criteria", "fix failing tests", "investigate and report").

3. Run limits
   - The run's execution limits (timebox / max tool calls / max iterations), if the ticket defines them. Agents must treat these as hard stop conditions.

### Standard instruction template
When launching an agent, use the following template (adapt as needed to the agent tool, but keep the semantics):

- Ticket: `<ticket-id>`
- Ticket file: `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/ticket.md`
- Scope: `<what to do>`
- Limits: follow `agent_limits` in the ticket (or repo defaults if not present)
- Stop behavior: on limit hit, stop work and write a run log entry to:
  - `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/logs/<run_started>-<run_id>.jsonl`

### Mandatory agent procedure (vendor-agnostic)
Given a ticket assignment, an agent must:

1. Open the ticket file at `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/ticket.md`.
2. Identify acceptance criteria and verification steps from the ticket.
3. Plan minimally: determine the smallest change set that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
4. Implement within limits.
5. Verify using the ticket's verification steps (or reasonable defaults if absent).
6. Log the run:
   - Write progress and outcomes to a per-run log file:
     - `/.tickets/<ticket-id>/logs/<run_started>-<run_id>.jsonl`
   - If the agent cannot write files, it must output the log content in its final response so a human/tool can persist it.

### What to do if the ticket is missing or invalid
If the assigned ticket file cannot be found, or is missing required sections:
- The agent must not proceed with implementation.
- The agent must log the issue and request clarification, or propose a minimal ticket fix as its output.

### Multi-ticket assignments (rare)
If an agent is assigned more than one ticket in a single run:
- The run instructions must list ticket IDs in priority order.
- The agent must work on only one ticket at a time, logging separately under each ticket’s logs directory.
- Prefer splitting work into separate runs for clarity.

### Human responsibility
Humans (or an orchestrator) are responsible for:
- selecting which tickets are assigned to which agents
- ensuring two agents are not intentionally assigned the same ticket unless parallel exploration is desired

---

## Agent workflow (recommended protocol)
Agents MUST:
- Read the ticket before starting work.
- Respect `assignment.mode` (do not work tickets marked `human_only`).
- Respect hard limits in `agent_limits`; if a limit is reached, stop and write a log entry.
- At the end of an iteration (success or failure), write a log entry that includes verification results or explains why verification was not run.
- If `max_iterations` is reached without completion, stop and log a recommendation (tighten criteria, split subtickets, or request a human decision).

Humans using agentic coding tools can follow the same protocol; use `--machine` logging with `actor_type: agent` and an `actor_id` that names the tool and the human (e.g., `cursor (human:@alice)`).

---

## Splitting tickets (subtickets) in parallel workflows
If an agent discovers a ticket is too large or should be parallelized:
1) Create subtickets with `./scripts/tickets new`.
2) Link with `related` (and only use `dependencies`/`blocks` when there is a real ordering constraint).
3) Log the split on the original ticket and include `tickets_created`.
4) Ensure each new ticket is executable in isolation by copying/adapting the minimum required context into the child `ticket.md`, and writing a first child log entry that includes `created_from` and `context_carried_over` when possible.

Avoid maintaining an authoritative “subtickets list” by frequently editing the parent `ticket.md` (it’s a merge-conflict hotspot). Prefer derived views and logs.

---

## Validation, issues reports, and repair
- `./scripts/tickets validate`:
  - exit `0`: ok
  - exit `1`: validation errors
  - exit `2`: tooling/IO errors

- `./scripts/tickets validate --issues` emits a machine-readable report with:
  - all `issues` (errors and warnings), and
  - a `repairs` section that can be edited and consumed by `tickets repair` in `--non-interactive` mode.

Minimal shape (example):
```yaml
schema_version: 1
tool: "tickets"
generated_at: "2026-01-29T00:00:00Z"
issues: []
repairs:
  - id: "R0001"
    enabled: false
    safe: true
    action: "add_sections"
    ticket_path: "/.tickets/<id>/ticket.md"
    params: {}
```

- `./scripts/tickets repair --issues-file <path>` applies enabled repairs:
  - Safe repairs can be non-interactive.
  - Disruptive repairs (like changing `id`) must have explicit decisions filled in (or require interactive mode).

---

## Safety & hygiene
- Do not write secrets into tickets or logs.
- Avoid pasting large environment dumps into logs.
- Prefer minimal diffs; avoid unrelated refactors.
- When in doubt, add a log entry with decisions and next steps, and hand off.
